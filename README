= XO

XO (for Exoskeleton), is an extension for Backbone.js. It's main purpose to provide a much templating system, based in HTML, rather then another markup language with Mustache. It does this by introducing schematics.

It uses data attritubes on HTML elements prefixed with `xo-` to indicate links with Backbone Views.
